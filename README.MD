# React Native Chat App

## Plans to finish:
- I haven't made the database yet
- I don't know how to connect the app to the database yet
- I don't have a register function yet
- I still don't know how to make the login function YET
- Send message
- View user profile

## Future plans (if I have time):
- If I were to make any of my future plans, my first step is to change the tabs navigation to a shelf (sidebar) navigation
- User settings page
- Private one on one convos
  - If private one on one convos is done, then I'll delete the global chat
  - I don't know the most optimal way to store private convos yet, database structure wise
- Send pictures, voice messages / mails, after these then I'll do the group chats
- Group chats, I know for sure this one is going to be way harder than the private convos

## Note:
I don't know when I'm going to finish the future plans, since I'd rather make another "small" project rather than finishing one big one, it'll look better on my resume, IF I get employed (hopefully soon!) that's most likely when I'll make more passion projects
